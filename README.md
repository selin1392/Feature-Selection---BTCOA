# Feature-Selection---BTCOA
A two‑stage hybrid filter–wrapper feature selection framework for high‑dimensional low‑sample‑size (HDLSS) biomedical data, combining graph‑based filtering with Binary Tangent–Cotangent Optimization (BTCOA). The method improves classification accuracy and is well suited for parallel and high‑performance computing (HPC) environments.
